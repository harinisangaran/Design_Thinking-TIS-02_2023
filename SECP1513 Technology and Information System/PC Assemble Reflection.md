It was my very first time disassembling and reassmbling a PC and I must say that I was much more excited during the lab session than the entire time I was waiting for it. It was definitely knowledgeable as I finally knew the components of the system unit and also understand how fragile they are. I would say I was quite proud with our groups work as once we set up the PC and testes it, it worked in one go!

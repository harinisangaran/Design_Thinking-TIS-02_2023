We visited Petronas and Huawei in our industrial visit and must I say, it was such a fun activity yet knowledgeable. I bonded so much better with my classmates during this visit as it was a very different environment compared to our classes where everyone is stressed about studies and is more focused. At Petronas, we had talks with 2 representatives who were Mr. Ninderjit and Mr. Roman. Mr. Ninderjit explained on how Petronas is slowly converting its huge database to cloud and explained in detail about it whereas Mr. Roman emphasised on the skills we would require in our future work life to be relevant to the industry. Then, we went to Huawei where they showcased their latest technologies and how it could make our lives much more easier. For example, they explained how Ideahub works and how it could make video conferencing much more effective and convenient.

Based on this industrial visit, we were required to do a newsletter as a group.

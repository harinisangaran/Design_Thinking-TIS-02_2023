Career Talk was split into 2 segments where the first segment was by Mr. Habib who explained about his company and their services, where they help graduates and others to edit their resume/CV in a proper manner. For example, many students and graduates this day use Canva templates to create their resume/CV. Based on Mr. Habib, employers tend to overlook the key details when it is not written appropriately like using Canva templates. When you're looking for a job, the last thing you want is your employer to turn you down because they couldn't find the skills they needed in your resume/CV. I think that was something every student ad graduate needed to hear to increase their chances in employability. He also did explain on the soft skills we will need to stay relevant and important in our career.

The second segment of career talk was by PPG. They explained about the technologies and a brief explanation on things we would do as data engineers there. I liked how they said that they don't differentiate their interns to their junior executives which means that the interns get equal opportunities as the junior executives to showcase their talents and therefore, they are also not limited to learning only certain things but can learn more as overall.

Based on the industrial talk, I was required to do a poster individually.

My academic writing task was based on the Industrial Talk by Ms. Qistina Batrisyia who shared about system development at Credence. It was quite informative as I got to learn about Credence background and it intrigued me more to learn about Credence on my own that I ended up googling about it later on. Credence is a cloud and digital services company under Telekom Malaysia Berhad (TM). Honestly, I didn't know TM had a whole new branch under them for cloud computing until I attended this talk. Clearly, as this assignment is about academic writing, I learned about the difference between a regular report and academic writing.

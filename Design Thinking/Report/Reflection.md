This was my very first group assignment for SECP1013 and I was grouped up with Dayang, Farra and Dania. It was a pleasure working with them as all of them were easy going. I felt so comfortable working with them as we divided our tasks and we could complete it on time without having to remind each other about the due date. I definitely did learn that design thinking is a very effective way to solve any problems as you look into a problem stage by stage and find a solution in every phase. Therefore, there's very slight chances that you would miss out on any important notes on the problem. Design thinking concept should definitely be implemented by all working adults in their work life as it is a very effective way to resolve and rectify problems. It can also reduce the time taken to rectify the problem.

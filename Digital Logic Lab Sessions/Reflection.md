Digital Logic lab 1 and lab 3 were pair work and I was paired with Saranya. We were given integrated chips (ICs), breadboard and wires. We had to use the breadboard and ICs to build circuits that used NT, AND and OR gates. I enjoyed both lab sessions as it was one of the easiest lab sessions that I've had. As long as the connections were right, there wouldn't be any problems in running the circuit and getting the outcome we needed.

For Lab 2, we were required to create circuits and execute it using Deeds Simulator.
